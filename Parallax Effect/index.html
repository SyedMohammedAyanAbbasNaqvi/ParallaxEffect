        <h2>Cherry Blossom Or ( Sakura 'さくら' Trees)</h2>
        <p> A cherry blossom, also known as a Japanese cherry or sakura, is a flower of trees in the genus Prunus or the Prunus subgenus Cerasus.
            Wild species of the cherry tree are widely distributed, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere.They are common in East Asia, especially in Japan.
            They generally refer to ornamental cherry trees, not cherry trees grown for their fruit.
            The cherry blossom is considered the national flower of Japan.
            In Europe, from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Collingwood Ingram collected and studied Japanese cherry blossoms and created various ornamental cultivars.
            The culture of ornamental cherry blossoms soon began to spread.
            In the United States, ornamental cherry blossoms began to spread after Japan presented them as a token of friendship in 1912.
            Cherry blossoms have been described as having a beautiful smell, and have been the inspiration for many candles and incense.</p>

            <h2> Flower Viewing in Japan </h2>
                <p>Hanami" is the centuries-old practice of drinking under a blooming sakura (桜 or 櫻; さくら or サクラ) or ume tree.
                    The custom is said to have started during the Nara period (710-794), when it was ume blossoms that people admired in the beginning, 
                    but by the Heian period (794-1185), cherry blossoms had come to attract more attention, and 'hanami' was synonymous with 'sakura'.
                    From then on, in both waka and haiku, "flowers" (花, hana) meant "cherry blossoms". The custom was originally limited to the elite of the Imperial Court but soon spread to samurai society and, 
                    by the Edo period, to the common people as well. Tokugawa Yoshimune planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the sakura trees, people had lunch and drank sake in cheerful feasts.
                    Since a book written in the Heian period mentions "weeping cherry" ('しだり櫻, 糸櫻'), one of the cultivars with pendulous branches, 
                    it is considered that Prunus itosakura 'Pendula' (Sidare-zakura) is the oldest cultivar in Japan. In the Kamakura period, when the population increased in the southern Kanto region, the Oshima cherry, 
                    which originated in Izu Oshima Island, was brought to Honshu and cultivated there, and then brought to the capital, Kyoto. In the Muromachi period, the Sato-zakura Group, 
                    which was born from complex interspecific hybrids based on Oshima cherry, began to appear.

            <h2> Symbolism in Japan </h2>
            <p>Many wild species and cultivars bloom from March to April in the Northern Hemisphere.
                Wild species, even if they are the same species, are genetically different from one tree to another, 
                so even if they are planted in the same place, there is some variation in the time when they reach full bloom. 
                On the other hand, cultivars are clones propagated by grafting or cutting, so each tree of the same cultivar planted in the same place is in full bloom and scattered all at once.
                Some wild species, such as Edo higan and the cultivars developed from them, are in full bloom before the leaves open, giving a showy impression to the people who enjoy them. 
                Yoshino cherry became popular as a cherry tree for cherry-blossom viewing because, 
                in addition to these characteristics of simultaneous flowering and the fact that the flowers are in full bloom before the leaves open, 
                it bears many flowers and multiplies to become a big tree. Many cultivars of the Sato-zakura group, which were born from complex interspecific hybrids based on Oshima cherry, 
                are often used for ornamental purposes and generally reach full bloom a few days after two weeks after Yoshino cherry reaches full bloom</p>
